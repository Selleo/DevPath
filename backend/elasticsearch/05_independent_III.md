## Elasticsearch

### What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucene and was first released in 2010. Known for its simple REST APIs, distributed nature, speed, and scalability. Commonly referred to as the ELK Stack (after Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana).

### What is Elasticsearch used for?

The speed and scalability of Elasticsearch and its ability to index many types of content mean that it can be used for a number of use cases:

* Application search
* Website search
* Logging and log analytics
* Infrastructure metrics and container monitoring
* Application performance monitoring
* Geospatial data analysis and visualization
* Security analytics
* Business analytics

- Kibana / curl / httpie or any other REST client

### üì¶ Setup

```bash
$ curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bartlomiejdanek/2413a5f19a1471f78856772cdb5b8130/raw/2967ba039e098fdab78f98ca278158c5be84f462/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up
```

Visit `http://localhost:5601` to get access to Kibana or `http://localhost:9200` to get pure ES.
