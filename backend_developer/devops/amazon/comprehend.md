# Comprehend

Discover insights and relationships in text.

Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. The service identifies the language of the text; extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events; understands how positive or negative the text is; analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech; and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic. Using these APIs, you can analyze text and apply the results in a wide range of applications including voice of customer analysis, intelligent document search, and content personalization for web applications.
The service constantly learns and improves from a variety of information sources, including Amazon.com product descriptions and consumer reviews – one of the largest natural language data sets in the world – to keep pace with the evolution of language.
