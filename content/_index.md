----

Welcome in our knowledge base **DevPath** repository.

# The goal
- Unification of fundamentals knowledge across the company
- Clear developer **growth path**
- Reduce the competence gap
- Skill evaluation

# The structure

This website contains paths that contain fundamentals on one of our 4 paths that you can pick from:
- Web development (backend & frontend)
- UX/UI design
- DevOps
- Quality assurance

The common part is the same for each path.

Each path is split into levels, so you can progress gradually and learn the most essential things first, before deep dive into more difficult things.

# What's next?

The path doesn't contain mature Mid developer things, as well as senior & expert knowledge, for a simple reason. We've decided that from mid-level, it's hard to decide what is fundamental, and you should be ready to pick by yourself in which are would like to be an expert of.
