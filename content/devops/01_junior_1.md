# Junior 1 DevOps

After finishing this step you should be able to work with the AWS Services that are most commonly used on our projects. You should feel comfortable performing tasks using Terraform and setup CICD pipeline for a project. You understand and can work with ECS as container orchestration tool. You will be comfortable working in Linux environment and will be familiar with Linux toolset and some basic SysOps concepts.

- Understand infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts
- Understand Terraform's purpose (vs other IaC)
- Work with Terraform CLI
- Understand general Terraform concepts, such as state, providers, etc.
- Use basic parts of Terraform such as modules, variables, outputs, local variables, etc.
- Evaluate already existing Terraform code and apply changes to it

**[SysOps basics](#sysops-basics)**
- Understand DNS and different record types
- Explain basic networking concepts(ipv4/v6, masks, private/public network, etc.)
- Work with common Linux tools

**[Container orchestration](#container-orchestration)**
- Explain and understand conteiner orchestration and it's benefits and drawbacks
- Work and perform day-to-day tasks on working system
- Evaluate existing

**[CICD](#cicd)**
- Explain benefits of CICD toolset
