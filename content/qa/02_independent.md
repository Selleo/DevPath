## 📦 Testing and process

Recognize proper priorities of encountered risks and issues. Be aware of how important is to include static testing such as reviewing business requirements. Seek for the best proportions in terms of both testing and overall QA activities.

### 🎤 Interview

- What is the relation between bug's severity and priority?
- Why do we need to set the priorities of reported bugs?
- Why do we need to analyse the risk of impact of a change? How to use technical knowledge to recognize risks? How could domain knowledge help?
- What are the main characteristics of a high-quality business requirements? Why are they so important?
- How can we apply Pareto principle in testing?
- What are some examples of actions to do while onboarding a QA engineer on a project? Why is it worth to keep those things written on a checklist?
- What are the most important of the QA activities? How to manage and prioritize them in case of limited velocity?
- Is it important to know the details of the implementation? How to find a good balance between technical and business knowledge? In what ways the technical knowledge can help the QA engineer?

### 📝 Katas

- Plan your tests of features and fixes. Describe how would you test an example functionality
- Show me an example of a reported issue for which the assignee needed help with reproducing. Is there something that you could do better to avoid such situation?
- Define the risks based on a few examples of functionalities/bugs and set proper priorities
- Testing in real - doing an example task on an examinee's project

## 📦 Technical competence

Extend the way you use known technologies and tools for more advanced tasks.

### 🎓 Learn

- 📗 [Cucumber/Gherkin - best practices](https://automationpanda.com/2017/01/30/bdd-101-writing-good-gherkin/)

### 📝 Katas

- Gather technical information about an error (UI, console, request's response, logs) and recognize which ones are the most useful
- Use gathered information to identify a potential area of the bug (Frontend/Backend)
- Write test scenarios in Gherkin to cover example functionality, using BDD approach
