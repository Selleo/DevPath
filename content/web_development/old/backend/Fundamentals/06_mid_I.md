## ðŸ“¦ Pair programming

- Complex problem solving skills will be verified during pair programming session
- Problems are of algorithmic yet pragmatic/practical nature
- Pairing session can take between 120 and 240 minutes, depending on developer efficiency
  - Complete problem solution may not necessarily be expected
- Developer can use any language/framework, but need to come prepared with a testing framework, database, application scaffolding etc. in place
- Potential tasks can be found ðŸ“— [here](https://gist.github.com/stevo/80aa460769fc4b90543994e0bc58ccc9#file-requirements_part_6-md)
  - Task requirements can be **slightly** changed for individual sessions
- All skills acquired during development path will be verified, including
  - Requirements analysis
  - Design Patterns
  - Applying principles
  - Debugging skills
  - Test Driven Development

## ðŸ“¦ Skills & practices / Code Benchmarking

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- Benchmarking significant code change on systems with expected high-load
- Practical knowledge: benchmark a snippet of code
- General concept of load/stress testing (JMeter, Apache Bench)
  - Distributed AWS instances + monitoring and graphs analysis
  - Testing in context of one process
- Monitoring / Profiling

## ðŸ“¦ Skills & practices / Optimistic / Pessimistic / Distributed locking

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- Optimistic - comparing a know (retrieved) value (i.e. version, timestamp)
  - Concept of resolving conflicts (i.e. comparing actual changes)
- Pessimistic - lock resource for updating until lock is released
  - Database level
    - We can lock individual record, table...
    - We can lock read, write, both etc.
  - Implementation level
    - Mutexes
- Distributed locking https://redis.io/topics/distlock
- Rollbacks / Transactions in external systems that do not support it
  - Command pattern
  - "Test driving" (to_sql vs to_a on relation)

## ðŸ“¦ Skills & practices / Message Brokers

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- Examples: RabbitMQ, KAFKA, SQS
- Why?
  - Scaling / Stream processing (parallel processing)
  - Message delivery / Event bus (cross system communication)
  - Ensure some additional functionalities
    - At least once delivery / at most once delivery etc.
    - Streams / Channels
    - Active acknowledging of processing a message
- Advantages
  - Decoupling
  - Fault tolerance
  - Scaling

## ðŸ“¦ Skills & practices / (Micro)Service Oriented Architecture

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- Communication (brokers)
- Discovery (switching replicas, RPC)
- Identifying domains for purpose of
  - scaling
  - availability
- **SOA**
  - uÅ¼ywa enterprise service bus (esb)
  - korzysta zazwyczaj z jednego storage
  - zazwyczaj jest to szereg usÅ‚ug zaleÅ¼nych od siebie i komunikujÄ…cych sie pomiÄ™dzy sobÄ…
- **MS**
  - uÅ¼ywa prostszych kanalow komunikacji jak message brokers
  - kaÅ¼dy serwis posiada swoj wÅ‚asny data store
  - niezaleÅ¼ne byty realizujÄ…ce jakieÅ› konkretne zadania
  - "dumb pipes" - nie powinniÅ›my caÅ‚kowicie polegaÄ‡ na infrastrukturze

## ðŸ“¦ Misc / CQRS

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- Rozdzielenie odczytu od zapisu
  - Nie tylko na poziomie metod, ale na poziomie klas
  - Decouple response from DB
- Problemy
  - Frontend / Eventual Consistency
  - Failures
- Optimistic UI
- Denormalizing data

## ðŸ“¦ Misc / Idempotency (term)

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077412/what-is-an-idempotent-operation
- ðŸ“— [Concept of idempotency key in Stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/blob/b13fc8465f0a43ea4e7de8fe85c1cafdd5ea59d7/lib/stripe/api_operations/delete.rb#L15)
- https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-function-idempotent/
- "Calling same thing with same arguments should not cause any adverse side effects"
  - i.e. idempotency key added to message (uuid during creation as example)
  - silently handling specific classes of errors

### ðŸ“¦ Misc / Hashing / checksums

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- Hashing == funkcja skrÃ³tu - na podstawie inputu generowanie "unikalnego" ciÄ…gu znakÃ³w
- Application
    - Generating key for caching (i.e. assets)
    - Data corruption on any kind of transport, tampering prevention (i.e. MD5)
    - Comparison, indexing (SHA) (i.e. binary data duplicates, bit-torrent)

## ðŸ“¦ Misc / base64

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- encryption vs encoding
- used for encoding binary data to text, where binary can't be used (email attachments, small binary files in json)

## ðŸ“¦ Misc / JSON Web Tokens

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- 3 segments
  - header
  - payload
  - signature (header + payload) - prevents payload tampering
- Use long secrets for signing
- For stateless systems
  - whitelisting (sign-out removes JWT ID from some store)
  - payload can stores useful session-oriented data
  - standard for JWT
- Disadvantages
  - Need to be securely designed (especially in relation to claims)
  - Size
- Claims https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml
- Has to be used when it makes sense

## ðŸ“¦ Misc / Eventual Consistency (term)

### ðŸŽ“ Learn
- ðŸ“— [Eventual Consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)

### Takeaways

- State of the system has to become consistent at some point in time, but may not be consistent in given point in time
- Introduced significant complexity but can allow high scalability
- E.g.
  - DNS
  - Bank transfer (your balance is reduced, but other party balance has not increased)

### ðŸŽ¤ Interview

- Teach me what is the eventual consistency
- Tell me what can be the consequences of the eventual consistency?

## ðŸ“¦ Misc / Deployment strategies

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- Heroku / Capistrano = deploy + restart - Rolling deployments (you can revert)
- Blue/Green deployment / 0-downtime
  - Routing part of traffic to newly deployed instance
  - Problems with
    - migrations
    - DNS
  - Needs extra monitoring and control to get advantages out of Blue/Green
- Canary Release (Incremental Rollout, Phased Rollout) - automated Blue/Green
- ðŸ“— [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/pl/)
  - wszystkie zewnÄ™trzne rzeczy dostarczaÄ‡ przez envy (not in DB, not harcoded)
  - nie opieraÄ‡ siÄ™ na state maszyny (np. filesystem, tmp)
  - be close to your production environment

### ðŸŽ¤ Interview

  - Routing part of traffic to newly deployed instance
  - Problems with: migrations & DNS
- Tell me about 12-factor app methodology

## ðŸ“¦ Misc / HTTP

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP
- Stateless
  - Mitigated with Cookies (stays in place when tab closes)
    - cookies are scope to domain
  - and sessions (ends when tab closes)
- Not encrypted
  - HTTPS is encrypted
- Standard of data transmission based on TCP in Client/Server architecture
- Request/Response cycle (at least in version 1)
- IP / DNS
- Headers
    - Method: POST / GET / PUT / DELETE/ HEAD...
        - HEAD - no response body, only headers. I.e. for health-check
        - OPTIONS - what methods given path handles
        - PATCH (subset of attributes) vs PUT (all attributes)
    - Content-Type
- Basic authentication support
- 1.1 supports sending multiple request in one connection
