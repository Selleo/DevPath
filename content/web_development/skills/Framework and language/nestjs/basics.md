## üì¶ NestJS

In this section you will build a NestJS application with most common features and gain working knowledge about NestJS.

### üéì Learn

### üìù Katas

- Create a simple express app with all CRUD end-points. Discuss with your mentor the requirements for the app.

**Useful Libraries**

The useful libraries can be found in [the content bank](./content_bank.md).

**A Sample Application's Description**

- Admin panel
    - Admin user created from DB seeds
    - Admin can create users in admin panel
        - When admin creates a user then email and password (autogenerated) are sent via email
    - Admin can manage categories and products
        - add categories (just a name, uid, and description)
        - add products (name, uuid [unique!], image, description, at least one category, number of products in stock)
        - edit categories/products
        - remove categories (if no products are connected)
        - archive product (set archived_at field to time when it happened, archived products cannot be purchased after this time)
    - Admin can see paginated list of categories (with filters and search)
    - Admin can see paginated list of products (with filters and search)
    - Admin can see paginated list of purchases (with filters and search)
    - Admin can export filtered purchases to XLS
    - Admin can import products with CSV file
    - Admin can view statistics of sold products
- User panel

    - User can edit email, password, first name, last name
    - User cannot access admin panel namespace
    - User can buy a product (number of products in stock is decreased)
    - User can see history of his purchases
- Implement REST api for products (all actions)
- Implement authorization on top of this application, use it in proper places
- Implement a state machine for purchases
- Use exception handling in controller and in one of your service objects
- Use three code analysis packages
- Use passport.js for authentication
- Add sign up, login, reset password

### üé§ Interview

The interview is based on questions from [the official NestJS course](https://learn.nestjs.com).

During a verification, we will go through the questions from the course and check their practical usage in the web application.

Prepare practical examples to present the usage of the framework in the scope of the course. You can also build a sample application described above and use that for presenting the skill.
