## üì¶ NestJS

In this section you will build a NestJS application with most common features and gain working knowledge about NestJS.

### üéì Learn

- [Express JS Crash Course (watching - 1h 14min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE)
- [Express - Request Methods (reading, 30min)](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req)
- [Express - Response Methods (reading, 30min)](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res)
- [Official NestJS Course (watching, ~ 5h)](https://learn.nestjs.com)
- An alternative to the official course: [Opanuj NestJS i zosta≈Ñ profesjonalnym programistƒÖ Node.js (watching, 16h 10min)](https://www.udemy.com/course/kurs-frameworka-nest-js)

### üìù Katas

- Create a simple express app with all CRUD end-points. Discuss with your mentor the requirements for the app.

**Useful Libraries**

The useful libraries can be found in [the content bank](./content_bank.md).

**A Sample Application's Description**

- Admin panel
    - Admin user created from DB seeds
    - Admin can create users in admin panel
        - When admin creates a user then email and password (autogenerated) are sent via email
    - Admin can manage categories and products
        - add categories (just a name, uid, and description)
        - add products (name, uuid [unique!], image, description, at least one category, number of products in stock)
        - edit categories/products
        - remove categories (if no products are connected)
        - archive product (set archived_at field to time when it happened, archived products cannot be purchased after this time)
    - Admin can see paginated list of categories (with filters and search)
    - Admin can see paginated list of products (with filters and search)
    - Admin can see paginated list of purchases (with filters and search)
    - Admin can export filtered purchases to XLS
    - Admin can import products with CSV file
    - Admin can view statistics of sold products
- User panel
    - User can log in by email/password
    - User can reset password
    - User can edit email, password, first name, last name
    - User cannot access admin panel namespace
    - User can buy a product (number of products in stock is decreased)
    - User can see history of his purchases
- Implement REST api for products (all actions)
- Implement authorization on top of this application, use it in proper places
- Implement a state machine for purchases
- Use exception handling in controller and in one of your service objects
- Use three code analysis packages
- Use passport.js for authentication
- Add sign up, login, reset password

### üé§ Interview

During a verification, we will go through the questions located in the following list. 
Prepare an application that can present answers for these points. 
During the session, you will be asked to perform a programming drill to implement a couple of points from the list, e.g., to create a partial config or a service.
