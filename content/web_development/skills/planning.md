## Understanding the Business

## Preparing Stories

In this step we have Epics and Features, but they are too abstract to effectively track and commit to. Our goal in this step is to create Stories that will let us divide Features into smaller chunks, which makes it easier to ship meaningful working parts of the new Feature.

## ðŸ“¦ Defining a Story

### ðŸŽ“ Learn

- How do you make sure that the story can be picked by someone else on the go?

## Planning

As you can already see we need to do a lot of preparation before we start the planning session. A good preparation however makes the process more reliable and possibly answers 90% of the questions that would otherwise appear during the development phase.

In this step we already have Stories that represent user flows and shippable part. We've discussed _what_ we need to ship and we should focus now on _how_ we want to ship.
