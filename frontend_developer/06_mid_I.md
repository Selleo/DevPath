- Build a simple application with a chart. Use RxJS to generate the chart data series for Bitcoin & Etherum. Every second, RxJS should randomly generate add new value (in the specified range for each currency). Present last 30 values of the currencies on the chart. Update with animation every time when the data series has changed.
